### Project: Online Banking System Using Java Programming

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Java-based online banking system that enables users to create accounts, manage personal information, and perform banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers.

### Key Activities
**1. Account Management:** Allows users to create new bank accounts, view account details, and manage personal information.\
**2. Transaction Handling:** Provides functionalities for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as transferring money between accounts.\
**3. Transaction History Tracking:** Maintains a detailed transaction history for each account, enabling users to review past transactions.

### Technologies Used
**1. Java (JDK 22.0.2):** The primary programming language.\
**2. Java Collections Framework:** Utilized to manage data structures such as ArrayList for storing multiple bank accounts.\
**3. Notepad:** Used as a simple text editor to write and edit the Java code.\
**4. Command Prompt(cmd):** Used to compile and run the Java program, providing an interface to execute Java commands and interact with the application.

### Key Insights
**1. Enhanced User Interaction:** Utilizes Java I/O for seamless user interaction through a command-line interface for managing accounts and transactions.\
**2. Object-Oriented Design:** Employs OOP principles to ensure modular,maintainable code with reusable classes for various banking operations.\
**3. Transaction Management:** Implements secure and efficient handling of financial transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.\
**4. Dynamic Data Handling:** Uses Java Collections Framework to efficiently manage dynamic data, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### Conclusion
The online banking system program effectively applies Javaâ€™s object-oriented principles and data handling capabilities to deliver a functional and secure banking application. It provides essential features like account management, transaction processing, and history tracking, showcasing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
